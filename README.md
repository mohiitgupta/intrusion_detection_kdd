Team members: Mohit Gupta, Jawad Raheel.

Requires kddcup.data file, available at http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99

The code file is project.py which first loads the data in the KDD data set above. Then runs the following three machine learning models: SVM, Artificial Neural Network, and Decision Tree. It records the F-1 scores, accuracy, and running time, for each of the three models in results.txt. It is written in Python 3 and requires numpy, sklearn libraries installed.
